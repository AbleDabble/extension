# Chest 
This extension tells you what the best move is on chess.com and provides you with an evaluation. It uses stockfish to provide evaluations and move suggestions. 
The engine works for both players and has a popup menu with the following settings: use time, how much time to use, and a depth setting for stockfish. To start the extension open a new game on chess.com with both the server running in the background and the extension installed. You will then need to open the extension popup and click new game. This will initialize the extension to read the moves from the browser.
